# GDM (Graph Data Model)
The Graph Data Model is made up of the following elements: Graph, Vertices, Edges, and Types, and Properties


## GDM Elements

**Graph**

**Vertices (Nodes)**

**Edges (Links)**

**Types**

**Properties**




# Labeling
**Labels** are the most important as they dictate the core semantics of the OGraph protocol.

Defined Labels:

- **Vertex/Node Label**
- **Edge/Link Label**
- **Model/Domain Label**
