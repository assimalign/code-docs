# Endpoints in terms of Graph

The main purpose of OGraph is to maintain REST while. In summary, the intent of OGraph is to represent our REST implementation in a graph model

Consider the following route; `/api/employees`

-  `/api/employees` represents `vertices('employees')`
	- `/api/employees/123` represents a single `vertex('employees', 123)`
# Keywords, 

## vertex('{vertex label}', '{vertex id}')
